# Hidden Message
## hw
The idea of “hiding” a message inside a larger data object (text file, image
etc.) is known as steganography. Write a Python function extract(text)
that takes a passage of English-language text as a string and that recovers
(and returns) the hidden message by taking the first letter of every fifth word
of the text.

For example, when applied to the passage shown below the function should
return the string “attack”.

Yesterday I saw an aardvark while walking my pet tortoise, Frank.
What a sight this was! Aarvarks are nocturnal animals appearing in
daylight with caution. Make sure to bring kippers when you visit.
